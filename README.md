# vrcfox
a barebones furry avatar for VRChat


Features customizable primary and secondary colors with a single material and limited color palette on both PC and Quest

TODO:
- [ ] Face tracking support
- [ ] Revise visemes and expressions. They're a little scuffed.
- [ ] Limited outfit customization (something better than that drab grey coat!)
- [ ] Add body geometry. Right now the only thing under the coat is air!

I don't expect the avatar to become widely used, but the following stuff is here just in case:

If you fork this and make your own avatar I'd kindly ask (but can't demand) that you not add NSFW/suggestive features to it. 

I'd also kindly ask that you make any addons public as well! The license doesn't include a ShareAlike clause, but it would be awesome to build a library of free outfits for other people to use.
