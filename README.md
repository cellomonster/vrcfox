# vrcfox
a barebones furry avatar for VRChat

![editor screenshot](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/518617115/83ffac45-41f4-4e1d-89a4-059d3c88be09)

Features customizable primary and secondary colors with a single material and limited color palette on both PC and Quest

## TODO:
- [ ] Better screenshots
- [ ] Add body geometry. Right now the only thing under the coat is air!
- [ ] Revise visemes and expression
- [ ] Face tracking support
- [ ] Limited outfit customization (something better than that drab grey coat!)

## Some notes:
⚠️ The blender file contains an export script for easy exporting. ⚠️ It merges all the meshes in a way that *preserves blendshapes on only the head.* ⚠️ It also *doesn't undo the mesh merge automatically, so you need to undo every time you export!!*

## Requests

I don't expect the avatar to become widely used, but the following stuff is here just in case:

If you fork this and make your own avatar I'd kindly ask (but can't demand) that you not add NSFW/suggestive features to it. 

I'd also kindly ask that you make any addons public as well! The license doesn't include a ShareAlike clause, but it would be awesome to build a library of free outfits for other people to use.
