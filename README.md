# vrcfox
a barebones furry avatar for VRChat
Features customizable primary and secondary colors with a single material and limited color palette on both PC and Quest

TODO:
- [ ] Face tracking support
- [ ] Revise visemes and expressions
- [ ] Limited outfit customization (something better than that drab grey coat!)

If you fork this and make your own avatar I'd kindly ask (but can't demand) that you not add NSFW/suggestive features to it.
