## TODO:
- [ ] Add body geometry. Right now the only thing under the coat is air!
- [ ] Revise visemes and expression
- [ ] Face tracking support
- [ ] Limited outfit customization (something better than that drab grey coat!)

## Some notes:
⚠️ The blender file contains an export script for easy exporting. ⚠️ It merges all the meshes, but meshes with modifiers cannot have blendshapes! ⚠️ It also *doesn't undo the mesh merge automatically, so you need to undo every time you export!!*
