# vrcfox
a simple optimized furry avatar for VRChat featuring basic body and color customization

## TODO:
- [ ] Add body geometry. Right now the only thing under the coat is air!
- [ ] Revise visemes and expression
- [ ] Face tracking support
- [ ] Limited outfit customization (something better than that drab grey coat!)

## Some notes:
⚠️ The blender file contains an export script for easy exporting. ⚠️ It merges all the meshes, but meshes with modifiers cannot have blendshapes! ⚠️ It also *doesn't undo the mesh merge automatically, so you need to undo every time you export!!*

## Attribution

## Requests

I don't expect the avatar to become widely used, but the following stuff is here just in case:

If you fork this and make your own avatar I'd kindly ask (but can't demand) that you not add NSFW/suggestive features to it. 

I'd also kindly ask that you make any addons public as well! The license doesn't include a ShareAlike clause, but it would be awesome to build a library of free outfits for other people to use.
